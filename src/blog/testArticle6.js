                <h3>What is Desktop Application Testing?</h3>
                <p>Desktop applications retain their important role in improving user engagement. This makes desktop application automation a key to strengthening the connection between software development teams and their end-users.</p>
                <p>A desktop application (app) is a program that runs independently in a desktop operating system.</p>
                <p>Unlike web apps, desktop apps require sufficient hardware resources to function. They are more perplexing to control due to the fact that certain apps are developed for certain environments and configurations.</p>
                <p>Desktop app testing is a software testing practice that examines the functionality, security, usability, and stability of the app after it is deployed.</p>
                <p>In desktop app testing, you need to pay close attention to installation as well as uninstallation tests to fully cover the app’s testing requirements.</p>
                <p>Desktop app testing being the most critical type of testing, needs diverse devices having different configurations to be involved. It not only tedious but also quite intricate to test a desktop application developed using a specific configuration and platform to be tested on diverse platforms having otherwise configurations. Our team is well equipped with the ability to derive test cases from Software Requirement Specification (SRS) and use cases thereby leaving not even a tiny aspect unanalyzed. Having hands-on experience with various testing tools and in-depth understanding of different business domains helps our testing teams to provide the discreet desktop application testing services.</p>

                 <h3>Desktop App Testing vs. Web App Testing</h3>
                 <img src={icon1} alt="problem solution" /> 
                <p>Web-based apps are hosted on the web server, allowing access from any user with an internet connection. Desktop apps run on personal computers or workstations, allowing access from the single machine on which it is installed.</p>
                <p>This leads to differences in the testing environments of desktop and web apps testing.</p>
                <p>In other words, desktop app testing is simpler in terms of intranets, where the number of its clients and servers are specified. In web apps, you have to ensure the app is compatible with multiple browsers and operating systems (OS).</p>
                <p>A desktop app is normally used by a single user on a specific operating system. This means you will have a specific environment to test and monitor results.</p>
                <p>Some common types of desktop app testing techniques include:</p>
                <p className= {styles.closerP}> - Functionality testing</p>
                <p className= {styles.closerP}> - GUI feature testing</p>
                <p className= {styles.closerP}> - Load testing</p>
                <p className= {styles.closerP}> - Backend (database) testing</p>
                <p className= {styles.closerP}> - Memory leaks defect testing</p>
                <p className= {styles.closerP}> - Compatibility testing</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, web apps are tested for their functionality, usability, accessibility, compatibility, performance, and security.</p>
                <h3>Best Practices for Desktop App Testing</h3>
                <p><strong>Have a plan before testing</strong></p>
                <p>A concrete plan helps you identify the predefined requirements prioritize which tests to automate.</p>
                <p>Make sure your team fully understands the requirements in the early stage.</p>
                <p>Identify which state the application under test (AUT) needs to be in so that you can easily navigate through a particular state in the future.</p>
                <p>Plan ahead the required set of data as well as how to best create, consume, and clean them up.</p>
                <p><strong>Identify the most-suited testing framework and tool</strong></p>
                <p>Figuring out the most suitable framework is an important step to maximize the capabilities of the testing process.</p>
                <p>There is no one-size-fits-all when it comes to automation testing tools. There are desktop automation tools available for a specific operating system, while other tools are restricted to certain scripting languages — for instance.</p>
                <p><strong>Pick an element locator strategy</strong></p>
                <p>When testing desktop apps, you need a solution that best supports the inspection of UI elements. Depending on the AUT, your team must choose a tool that can show properties such as name, ID, and class name, and so on, in the testing process.</p>
                <p><strong>Minimize project maintenance</strong></p>
                <p>Desktop app testing projects can be hectic without proper management in both test designs and tool usage. This problem can be resolved by embracing a low-maintenance mindset: prioritizing the reusability and maintenance of test artifacts throughout every stage of desktop app testing.</p>
