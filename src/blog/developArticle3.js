                    <h3>What is database development?</h3>
                    <p>Database development involves the development and maintenance of these systems, so that businesses can stay organised and use their data effectively.</p>
                    <p>Databases help both business owners and employees to organise and track inventory, employees, and customers.</p>
                    <p>Database development involves the development and maintenance of these systems, so that businesses can stay organised and use their data effectively.</p>
                    <p>Here are some examples of different business databases:</p>
                    <p><strong>Customer management</strong></p>
                    <p>These databases used to stores data which help you manage your customers. CRMs organise all of the information you have about current customers, leads, opportunities, and contacts. A record for one customer may include their contact details, their last orders, their favourite products, the total amount of purchases throughout their history, any returns, and details from any calls to customer service.</p>
                    <p>These databases are also often used to manage promotions and marketing, for email campaigns, and for preparing shipping labels.</p>
                    <p><strong>Personnel databases</strong></p>
                    <p>Databases can also be used to manage your employees. It can keep all of their information in one place, make it easy to schedule hours, and prevent errors with payroll. Personnel database is a collection of information like commission, salary, and wages, tax numbers, holiday time, and more.</p>
                    <p>These databases can also be linked with CRMs to create an association between customers and sales representatives.</p>
                    <p><strong>Inventory databases</strong></p>
                    <p>Inventory tracking databases designed to give you crucial information at a glance. They show how much inventory businesses have in their storage room, on store shelves, and in warehouses.</p>
                    <p>Many will integrate stock scanners and bar codes, forming a complete tracking system so products are monitored as they move between destinations and warehouse inventory never needs to be counted. These databases can send out alerts when supplies and products are low so they can be ordered before you run out from data warehouses.</p>
                    <p><strong>Analysis and big data</strong></p>
                    <p>Technology is allowing databases to become even smarter for an efficient data processing and data storage. Many can now be integrated together so business owners can predict future trends. An example would be if a report showed that productivity slowed so much on Fridays before a long weekend that staff should just be let go early those days.</p>
                    <p>These type database structures can also give you important information that allows you to segment your customers and better serve them. You can see if sales increase after marketing campaigns, and which customers respond best to which types of marketing.</p>

                  <p><strong>Benefits of database development</strong></p>
                  <img src={icon1} alt="problem solution" />
                   <p>Using database technology to gather, store and process information about your customers, suppliers and even competitors can give your business a distinct advantage.</p>
                   <p>Developing a database for your business can help you:</p>
                   <p className = {styles.closerP}> - reduce the amount of time you spend managing data</p> 
                   <p className = {styles.closerP}> - analyse data in a variety of ways</p> 
                   <p className = {styles.closerP}> - promote a disciplined approach to data management</p> 
                   <p className = {styles.closerP}> - turn disparate information into a valuable resource</p> 
                   <p className = {styles.closerP}> - improve the quality and consistency of information</p> 
                   <p>Many businesses do not have the time or resources available to gather and process large quantities of information. This may lead to a lack of information about:</p>
                   <p className = {styles.closerP}> - how their business is performing</p>
                   <p className = {styles.closerP}> - how profitable their product lines are</p>
                   <p className = {styles.closerP}> - if customers are making repeat purchases</p>
                   <p><strong>Role of data in your business</strong></p>
                   <p>A database management system can help you store a vast amount of data which, as it builds up over time, can become increasingly useful and valuable. For example:</p>
                    <p className = {styles.closerP}> - historical data can show business trends</p>
                    <p className = {styles.closerP}> - sales records can identify valuable customers</p>
                    <p>In addition, the disciplines required to gather, enter and process such data can help to ensure that your business runs in a regulated and properly managed way.</p>
                    <p>It&apos;s not always obvious what information is potentially valuable, so you should try to gather as much data as possible (bearing in mind your data protection responsibilities if you&apos;re collecting personal data).</p>
                    <p><strong>Databases and data protection</strong></p>
                    <p>Your gathering, storage and processing of customers&apos; personal data must comply with data protection legislation, including the requirement not to collect or process excessive or unnecessary personal data. In accordance with the UK data protection laws, you must ensure the personal data you are processing is:</p>
                    <p className = {styles.closerP}> - adequate - sufficient to properly fulfil your stated purpose </p>
                    <p className = {styles.closerP}> - relevant - has a rational link to that purpose</p>
                    <p className = {styles.closerP}> - limited to what is necessary - you do not hold more than you need for that purpose</p>
                    <p > </p>
                    <p > </p>

                    <p><strong>How can database development and maintenance improve your business?</strong></p>
                    <p>If you’re unsure if your business is using its databases at full capacity, or if your databases need an upgrade to stores data, there are a few things to consider:</p>
                    <p> - Do your databases “talk” to each other? Are they well integrated for proper data integrity? If you update one system, is this change reflected in another? If you’re not sure, speak to your employees. They’ll let you know if they’re continually entering the same information in multiple databases.</p>
                    <p> - Do your systems frequently crash? Database development and maintenance is useful for businesses that are frequently dealing with downtime. Often this is due to using legacy systems which are slow, clunky, and unable to be updated without risking further issues.</p>
                    <p> - Are your competitors using newer technology? One of the reasons why database development is so important is because it greatly improves customer service. If your competitors can offer a better, streamlined service, this may be because their backend systems and databases are working like a well-oiled machine.</p>
                    <p>A great software development company can build a database applications that will allow you better serve your customers and scale effectively. But choosing a company that understands database concepts, values user experience, and provides ongoing support is crucial.</p>
                    <p>Database maintenance is often forgotten about until businesses are dealing with a massive issue. By partnering with a company that can monitor and maintain your databases, you’ll stay online and keep your customers happy.</p>
