                <p>The success of any business depends on demand for its products, profitability and customer loyalty, which is directly related to product quality and its rapid adaptation to changing customer needs.</p>
                <p>The financial sector evolves extremely fast, so delays in launching updates or service issues may lead to unnecessary losses and a decline in competitiveness. In order to reduce the likelihood of errors or failures, software testing must be performed extremely accurately.</p>
                <p>EVEN MINOR ERRORS MUST BE RESOLVED PROMPTLY TO EXCLUDE POSSIBLE UNWANTED REPUTATIONAL AND FINANCIAL CONSEQUENCES FOR THE BANK OR PROCESSING COMPANY</p>
                <img src={icon2} alt="software" />
                <h3>REDUCING RISKS</h3>
                <p>Financial organisations use various software products that interact with each other. Often new features or application updates need to be rolled-out. The main job of the QA team is to verify that the changes included in the release do not affect the existing functionality of the modified components, the whole system or the surrounding environment. Manual testing is time-consuming and the human factor means that there is a high risk that some errors may remain unnoticed.</p>
                <p>Implementing automated testing and DevOps technologies helps financial institutions to reduce the cost of performing routine repetitive operations and eliminate the risk of human error. The same test script written once is reused many times for releasing further updates.</p>
                <h3>What is website & PWA App QA?</h3>
                <p>Website & PWA App QA (Quality Assurance) can be defined as the process of testing a website in order to discover mistakes, errors or oversights that may not have been noted during web development or design before going live. It is also referred to as QA testing. Note that QA begins way earlier, even before development begins. It starts as soon as the requirements for the website are laid out and culminates in testing. Its overarching concern is the quality of the overall site.</p>
                <h3>How to carry out website & PWA App QA testing</h3>
                <p>QA is no mean feat. Time and money need to be invested in order to make sure that a high-quality site is delivered to the users. Depending on the site’s complexity and project specifics, QA may need up to 50% of the budget allocation. </p>
                <p>In order to effectively carry out website QA, you need to define a process that will be followed throughout the testing phase. This process is commonly referred to as the QA process flow. The process flow breaks down the amount of time needed per testing phase, depending on the budget available and priority.</p>
                <h3>Factors to consider when designing a QA process flow</h3>
                <p>There are several factors that you need to consider when designing a QA process flow. These include:</p>
                <p><strong>Audience:</strong>Before you even start thinking about the site, you need to think about who you are building it for. This will help you define the correct platforms that your audience uses the most. And this will come in handy to narrow down the testing environments, for example, the browsers to use and devices to test.</p>
                <p><strong>Application type:</strong>You need to factor in the type of application that you are testing, as the testing approaches differ depending on the type of site. Is your site static or dynamic? Will you be testing a mobile site?</p>
                <p><strong>Test specificity:</strong> The test needs to be well defined and described, and cover one scenario with the outcome being clearly defined. Define the assumptions and preconditions. Use as much ‘real data’ (one that is as close to user input as possible) as you can.</p>
                <p><strong>Risk level:</strong>Are you building a high or low-risk site? The level of risk here is determined by site functionality and industry. For example, if your site collects user information, then you need to test that the information entered is correct. Moreover, you need to test for the information’s privacy. If financial transactions are carried out through your site, then you need to thoroughly test for security. </p>
                <p>On the other hand, for a static site, the emphasis should be on the UI (user interface) and functionality.</p>
              
                <h3>INVESTMENT IN YOUR TIME</h3>
                <p>A business that provides more user-friendly client services than its competitors has a much greater chance of gaining customer loyalty. The agile operation model, based on the iterative software development approach, is widely used in the financial sector. It allows changes to be introduced to programs faster than the traditional approach. As the frequency of application builds increases, test automation is crucially important.</p>
                <p>Automation reduces the time spent on full testing and development cycles, allowing the current status of the program code to be promptly monitored. Furthermore, rapid error detection facilitates their faster correction in order to make the best use of experts’ times by performing changes on the spot.</p>

                <h3>Reduce Time-To-Market with Early Testing</h3>

                  <img src={icon1} alt="problem solution" /> 
                  <p>If a product has to deliver quickly without any bugs, it should be tested throughout its development process. They were also under the pressure to roll out frequent upgrades of their flagship products. While the in-house development team can help build the project, without the dedicated testing team, their releases were being delayed.</p>
                  <p>In the competitive environment where users are spoilt for choice, these issues could easily lead to their customers switching loyalties. They’ve decided to overcome these issues and started to search for the best application testing services in the market. Finally, they set off on their journey with us.</p>
                  <p>Our solution is about to push testing towards the early phases of software development as described in agile methodologies. The main goal is not to detect any critical defects during the deployment phase, which required code patching. As such, there are no bugs in the project and increased code quality. To deliver them the right solution, we did a thorough analysis of the specialized nature of their product and then, went on to identify the challenges at hand.</p>
          
                
                
                  <h3>BENEFITS OF AUTOMATION TESTING</h3>
                  <p>Automated testing provides benefits in several areas:</p>
                  <p className={styles.closerP}> - Improves the reliability of testing by eliminating the influence of the human factor</p>
                  <p className={styles.closerP}> - Saves resources and eliminates the need for routine operations related to repetitive tests </p>
                  <p className={styles.closerP}> - Faster retesting and shortened time to market due to automating regression testing.</p>
                  <p>A prerequisite for successful testing is the selection of the right automation testing tools. Testers should also take into consideration the tool’s integration capabilities, customization requirements and its compatibility with the existing DevOps environment of the financial organization.</p>
           
                 <h3>Real Challenges</h3>
                 <p>They had several challenges to overcome to accomplish these goals:</p>
                 <p className={styles.closerP}> - They were working with legacy systems with large gaps in knowledge of the applications’ behavior</p>
                 <p className={styles.closerP}> - Inability to respond to the market quickly</p>
                 <p className={styles.closerP}> - The ineffective testing process, which was highly manual & time-consuming</p>
                 <p className={styles.closerP}> - The application had over 15+ browser extensions and had to work across different operating systems such as Win 10, Windows, and Mac. So it had to be tested across a wide variety of platforms and also needed to display properly on computers, smartphones, and Tablets.</p>
                
                 <h3>Our Testing solution</h3>
                 <p>We’ve deployed a QE (Quality Engineering) initiative with a structured approach that streamlined the QA process along with SDLC and reduced the number of defects to be fixed. The key highlights of our approach are:</p>
                 <p className={styles.closerP}> - Designed a robust testing strategy that included Compatibility Testing across various OS and Browser combination</p>
                 <p className={styles.closerP}> - Introduced test automation based on Selenium for wide adoption needed for continuous regression testing</p>
                 <p className={styles.closerP}> - Onboarded automation testers to automate the critical functions, which reduced the regression cycle</p>
                 <p className={styles.closerP}> - The dedicated manual testers documented the test cases and provided consistent feedback on the release quality</p>
                 <p className={styles.closerP}> - Requirements Traceability Matrix to ensure the timely execution and completion of the project</p>
                 <p>Results : </p>
                 <p className={styles.closerP}> - Actively monitored user experience through automation</p>
                 <p className={styles.closerP}> - Increase the test coverage of all applications by 90% and reduced the regression testing time by over 70% through our automation initiatives. The automated regression suite saved 40 man-hours per release cycle</p>
                 <p className={styles.closerP}> - All issues and enhancements to the product were listed systematically and tracked according to priority </p>
                 <p>With comprehensive testing strategies, we were detecting bugs even before the product reached production. We ensured that they had built a robust process for product testing to ensure that the final product would achieve consistent customer satisfaction. With the effective testing initiatives, they’ve reduced their development time, cost as well as associated stress for all stakeholders in business operations.</p>
                 <p>You can juggle many balls to keep your project release on budget and time, but should never compromise in quality by underestimating software testing. The costs of not testing software properly far outweigh the benefits of a fast yet defective software launch.
